Heyo, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is the first post on my personal site, a place for me to share my thoughts and projects.

I'm hoping to post here regularly. You can expect to see a mix of topics, from deep dives into software development and the tech I'm currently using, to my adventures in the great outdoors. So, who knows, you might find a post about my latest hiking trip right next to a tutorial on some obscure Go library.

Stay tuned for more!
